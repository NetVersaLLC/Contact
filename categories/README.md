Grabbing and Processing Categories

Some sites have custom ontologies to categorize a business. These
folders contain the code that grabs the categories from the site and
puts it into a format that's easy to import.

The counterpoint to this is in lib/tasks/SiteName/categories.rake
This is the place for the script that actually does the import.
