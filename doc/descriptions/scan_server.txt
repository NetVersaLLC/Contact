Scan Server

We have a scan server at: ec2-75-101-218-52.compute-1.amazonaws.com
The public address is: scan.netversa.com
Which points to the load balancer for EC2 thus you can't ssh into it.

Project Goals

The scan system needs to be able to accept a business's name, phone
number and zip code to perform a search across multiple local business
directories. Some examples would be Yahoo Local, Bing Local, Google
Places and Kudzu.

A scan needs to be done in real-time. An example site that operates
similarly is getlisted.org. It's worth checking out this system since
this is essentially what we want.

A scan of a single site needs to do the following:

1. Perform a search on the site for the business based on name, phone
number and/or zip.
2. Check the search results for the business, looking for an exact match
on the name.
3. There are three states possible for a business in the listing.
  a. unlisted: The business does not exist.
  b. unclaimed: The business is in the listing but it hasn't been
claimed/verified.
  c. claimed: The business is listed and claimed.
4. Also the scan needs to return the business address, zip code and
phone number listed on the site.
5. The returned information needs to be incorporated into the scan form
