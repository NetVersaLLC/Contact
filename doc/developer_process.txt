First you need to be setup in Pivotal Tracker and Github.
Please read about the git-pivotal gem here:
https://github.com/trydionel/git-pivotal

Install the gem:

gem install git-pivotal

In order to do the next part you will need:
1. Your name
2. Your Pivotal tracker API key
3. The project ID

The Town Center project id is 650173 but you may need to work on other
projects. The ID can be found here: http://screencast.com/t/ju9I8BPX

Next you need your Pivotal API key this can be found here:
https://www.pivotaltracker.com/accounts

Click on "Profile" and then the key is at the bottom under "API Token".
An example one will look like this: de2650b948c9e842f4e3685def823009

Next setup your git environment go into the repo and execute the following.
NOTE: You must change these values to the ones that are appropriate.

api_token=de2650b948c9e842f4e3685def823009
your_name="Developer Person"
project_id=650173

git config --global pivotal.api-token $api_token
git config --global pivotal.full-name $your_name
git config --global pivotal.only-mine true
git config -f .git/config pivotal.project-id $project_id

Now to begin your next coding story you use the command:

git feature

This will checkout the story from Pivotal and create a git branch for the
story. When you're complete with the story, only after everything has
been verified to be stable. You need to commit your code in the
ordinary way.

git commit -m "descriptiion of everything done in this commit" -a

When the code has been commited then you can finish the story.

git finish

This will update the pivotal story, Next you need to push the code.

The process is:

git pull --rebase origin master
git push origin master

Please open the pivotal story and add a comment. It's a
good idea to take a screencast demonstrating the feature if it's
appropriate to the story. Also, please include a link to the
commit in master. An example comment is:
